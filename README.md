# PracticalMachineLearningProject
Project for Practical Machine Learning course

This github repository contains my submission for the Practical Machine Learning Project.
There are 3 files in the repository:

1) This README file  
2) The HTML file, practical_machine_learning_final_project.html, produced by knitr based on executing the R script in the .Rmd file    
3) The .Rmd file, practical_machine_learning_final_project.Rmd, including the R script to build and test the machine learning algorithm  

To view my project output, download this repository and use a browser to view the above HTML file.
